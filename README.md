# Udacity Coursework

## Files attached
1. **Investigate_a_Dataset** : This was my first data analysis assignment. For the most part, it was an intro to pandas, numpy and manipulating DataFrames
2. **wrangle_act.pdf** : Project focused heaviy on the full data wrangling process (Gathering, Assess, Clean) and then some quick visualizations at the end. I apologize in advance for the long run window.
I had to use Tweeter Tweepy API to download JSON files and I want to follow the long downloading process closely.
